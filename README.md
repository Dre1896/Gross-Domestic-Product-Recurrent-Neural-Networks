# Gross Domestic Product Analysis using Time Series
<div align="center">
  <p align="justify">
This project utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and forecast the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends based on data from the FRED Economic Data St. Louis Database. It specifically explores how GDP has evolved over time and applies advanced time series analysis techniques to predict future economic scenarios. With the backdrop of the IMF's 2023 projection of a global GDP reaching $105 trillion, this analysis becomes crucial for understanding potential growth trajectories and economic resilience in varying global conditions.
