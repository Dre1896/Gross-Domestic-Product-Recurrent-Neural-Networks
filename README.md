This project is an exploration of Gross Domestic Product and Recurrent Neural Networks. Our project aims to evaluate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the world economy and incorporate time series analysis into this process. According to the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections from its 2023 World Economic Outlook report, the global GDP is expected to reach an impressive $105 trillion by the end of 2023, representing a $5 trillion increase from the previous year. 
This nominal figure reflects a substantial 5.3% growth in the world's economic output, with an inflation-adjusted increase of 2.8%. Despite a turbulent start to the year marked by financial challenges and inflation, some economies have shown resilience and are poised for growth. Notably, the United States is projected to maintain its position as the largest economy with a GDP of $26.9 trillion, followed by China at $19.4 trillion. India is expected to surpass the UK and become the fifth-largest economy with a projected GDP of $3.7 trillion in 2023. Our project will analyze these economic trends, incorporating time series data to gain deeper insights into the dynamics driving these changes and their potential implications for the global economy. It's important to note that while these projections provide valuable insights, they are based on assumptions made at the beginning of the year and may evolve as economic conditions change throughout 2023. Our evaluation will focus on the delicate balance between controlling inflation and promoting economic growth in the face of challenging liquidity conditions.
